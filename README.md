# WordLink Game
## Description
WordLink is an engaging word game built with Flutter, designed to challenge users to connect two words by adding one letter at a time. The goal is to transition from the start word to the end word, making sure each intermediate word is valid. The game supports multiple languages (French by default) and features a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Integrated Dictionary: Comes with a built-in english dictionary for immediate play, with the option for users to select a french dictionary by changing the langage.
- Timed Challenges: Players have 2 minutes to complete each challenge, adding excitement and urgency to the gameplay.
- Multi-language Support: Users can switch between French and English, affecting both the UI and the game's dictionary.
- Word Verification: Ensures that there is a valid chain of words from the start to the end word.
